# **Kaled Enríquez**

I'm Kaled Enríquez, a passionate computer science student on a journey to learn and explore the vast world of software development. I'm a very dedicated person and I'm determined to learn. This repository is where I experiment, learn, and document my projects as an aspiring software engineer.

## About Me
As a CS student, I'm constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and sharpen my skills. I firmly believe in the power of continuous learning and collaboration within the tech community.

## Current Focus
Currently, I'm diving deep into both the back-end and front-end realms of web development. Here's what I'm currently tinkering with:

### Back-End
- [![Flask](https://img.shields.io/badge/Flask-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=flask&logoColor=white)](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
  
- [![Node.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-339933?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white)](https://nodejs.org/)


### Front-End

### Databases
In addition to honing my skills in web development, I'm also working on mastering database management systems. Currently, I'm tinkering with:
- [![SQL Server](https://img.shields.io/badge/Microsoft_SQL_Server-CC2927?style=for-the-badge&logo=microsoft-sql-server&logoColor=white)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server)
  Exploring its robust features for relational data management.
- [![PostgreSQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/PostgreSQL-316192?style=for-the-badge&logo=postgresql&logoColor=white)](https://www.postgresql.org/)
  Diving into its scalability and extensibility for various data storage needs.
