# Kaled Enríquez

I'm Kaled Enríquez, a passionate computer science student on a journey to learn and explore the vast world of software development. I'm a very dedicated person and I'm determined to learn. This repository is where I experiment, learn, and document my projects as an aspiring software engineer.

## About Me
As a CS student, I'm constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and sharpen my skills. I firmly believe in the power of continuous learning and collaboration within the tech community.

## Current Focus
Currently, I'm diving deep into both the back-end and front-end realms of web development. Here's what I'm currently tinkering with:

### Back-End
- **Flask**: Leveraging its simplicity and flexibility for web development projects.
- **Node.js**: Exploring its asynchronous capabilities and building scalable server-side applications.

### Front-End
- **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript**: Crafting visually appealing and interactive user interfaces.
- **React**: Delving into component-based architecture to create dynamic web applications.

### Databases
In addition to honing my skills in web development, I'm also working on mastering database management systems. Currently, I'm tinkering with:
- **SQL Server**: Exploring its robust features for relational data management.
- **PostgreSQL**: Diving into its scalability and extensibility for various data storage needs.
